# CircusOfPlates

Circus of Plates is a Desktop game built by SwingUtilities that supports one / two players.

## Rules

The main goal is to collect packs of matching plates as much as possible. Each pack consists of 3 consecutive matching plates. Plates are matching if and only if they have the same color, regardless their shape. Each time you catch a new plate, it is added to your stack. The more plates you catch, the higher your stack will be. If either stacks (right or left) reaches the red line, the game is over. With each new pack you manage to collect, 5 extra points are added to your score, then, the whole pack disappears, meaning that your stack will be shrinked.

Black plates are nothing but a trick; to make the game harder. If you catch a black plate, your score decreases by 5 points. It means that one black plate can ruin what 3 plates have accomplished, so be careful.

If two players are competing, the game still ends when either players reaches the red line, and that with the highest score wins.


## How to PLay

A single player can use default ⇦ | ⇨ keys for moving.
If two players are playing, then, the second player will use A | D keys to move left and right, respectively.
